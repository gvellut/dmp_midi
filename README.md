# MIDI files for 200 Drum Machine Patterns + 260 Drum Machine Patterns

The code builds MIDI versions of the drum machine patterns from the books *200 Drum Machine Patterns* and *260 Drum Machine Patterns* by __RenÃ©-Pierre Bardet__.

It uses as input digital versions of the patterns taken from:
- https://github.com/montoyamoraga/drum-machine-patterns (*200 Drum Machine Patterns* only)
- https://github.com/stephenhandley/DrumMachinePatterns (patterns from both books)

## Install

The tool needs Python >= 3.7.

- Clone the project locally
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run

- Run with : `python -m dmpmid.cli -i input/README.md -o output`
    - Or use `-i input/Patterns_200.json` or `-i input/Patterns_260.json`
- The MIDI files will be generated in the `output` folder

## Using the generated MIDI

The generated MIDI follows the *General MIDI* convention: All drum instruments are on a single track on channel 10 and there is a specific MIDI note for each drum instrument. Those notes are listed on https://github.com/montoyamoraga/drum-machine-patterns

You may have to move some of the notes to a different drum pad in your DAW if your drum kit does not follow this convention. Or leave the notes as is and edit your kit to follow the convention.

Alternatively, you could edit the code in this project to map the instrument to a different MIDI note that fits your kit (by changing the numeric values in the `NOTE_MAPPING` global variable), then relaunch the tool to generate the custom MIDI files.

## Downloads

Pre-generated MIDI files can be downloaded in the release section of this project.

## Input files

The input files (with digital transcription of the patterns) are included in this repository for safekeeping.
